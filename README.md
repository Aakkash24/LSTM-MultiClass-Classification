# LSTM-MultiClass-Classification

The goal of this project is to develop a multiclass classification model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to classify news articles from the BBC World News dataset into different categories. The BBC World News dataset consists of news articles from various topics such as business, entertainment, politics, sport, and technology.

The LSTM model will be trained to learn the sequential patterns and dependencies in the text data, allowing it to capture long-term dependencies and make predictions based on the context of the input sequence. LSTM networks are particularly effective for processing and analyzing sequential data, making them suitable for text classification tasks.

The project will involve the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: The BBC World News dataset will be preprocessed to prepare it for training the LSTM model. This step may include tasks such as cleaning the text data, removing stop words, tokenizing the text into individual words, and converting the text into numerical representations that the LSTM model can process.

Model Architecture: An LSTM model will be designed and implemented using appropriate deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The model will consist of an LSTM layer followed by one or more dense layers for multiclass classification. The model's architecture will be tuned to find the optimal number of LSTM units, layers, and other hyperparameters.

Training and Validation: The preprocessed dataset will be split into training and validation sets. The LSTM model will be trained on the training set, and the performance will be evaluated on the validation set. During training, the model's weights will be updated iteratively using an appropriate optimization algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.

Evaluation: The trained LSTM model's performance will be evaluated using evaluation metrics suitable for multiclass classification, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model's predictions on the test set will be compared with the ground truth labels to assess its effectiveness in classifying news articles into the correct categories.

Hyperparameter Tuning: The model's hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and dropout rate, will be tuned to improve the model's performance. Techniques like cross-validation or grid search can be employed to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters.
